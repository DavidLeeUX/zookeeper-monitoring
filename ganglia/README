Recipes for ZooKeeper monitoring using Ganglia
----------------------------------------------

Ganglia Install guide: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ganglia/wiki/Ganglia%203.1.x%20Installation%20and%20Configuration 

Gmond configuration: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ganglia/wiki/Gmond%203.1.x%20General%20Configuration 

WARNING: I have wrote these instructions while installing and configuring the plugin on my desktop computer running Ubuntu 9.10. I've installed Ganglia using apt-get.

WARNING: I'm going to make the assumption that you know how to work with Ganglia. I'm also going to assume that you have already installed Gangli and everything works as expected.


Monitoring ZooKeeper using Ganglia is a simple as calling:

./check_zookeeper.py -o ganglia -s localhost:2181 

on each of the ZooKeeper cluster nodes. I'm making the assumption that you have already configured gmond and installed gmetric on each node.
