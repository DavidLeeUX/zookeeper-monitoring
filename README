Tools and Recipes for ZooKeeper Monitoring
------------------------------------------

This repository contains tools and recipes for monitoring Apache ZooKeeper.

Requirements
------------

ZooKeeper 3.4.0 or later or you can apply ZOOKEEPER-744 patch over the latest 3.3.x release.
The server should understand the 'mntr' 4letterword command. 

Python 2.6 (maybe it works on previous version but it's not tested yet).

Recipes
-------

My objective is to provide configuration recipes for Nagios, Cacti and Ganglia.

Check the subfolders for more details regarding each platform.
